# Cursor Project Rules

## Documentation
- Update docs with every change:
  - docs/CHANGELOG.md (summary)
  - backend/README.md and/or frontend/README.md (usage/env/scripts/APIs/UI)
- Ensure root README links any new docs/sections.

## Branch & PR
- Branch names: feature/*, fix/*, docs/*
- Use PR template and complete the docs checklist before merge.

## Environments
- Keep .env minimal; document required vars in READMEs.
- Client-exposed vars must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_.

## Commands
- Backend: npm run start:dev
- Frontend: npm run dev
- Before PR: build backend and frontend successfully.

## Style
- TypeScript strict defaults.
- Clear, descriptive names; avoid abbreviations.
